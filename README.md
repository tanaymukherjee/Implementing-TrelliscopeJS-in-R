# Implementing-TrelliscopeJS-in-R
Trelliscopejs is an R package that brings faceted visualizations to life while plugging in to common analytical workflows like ggplot2 or the “tidyverse”.

Trelliscope is a scalable, flexible, interactive approach to visualizing data. The trelliscopejs R package provides methods that make it easy to create a Trelliscope display specification for the Trelliscope JavaScript library trelliscopejs-lib. High-level functions are provided for creating displays from within dplyr (via summarise()) or ggplot2 (via facet_trelliscope()) workflows. Low-level functions are also provided for creating new interfaces.

In summary, trelliscope is based on the idea of “small multiples”, a simple but serious visualization technique.
